# Population & Workforce Dynamic Analysis 

## Overview
This Project analyzes how demographic changes impact workforce sustainability over time.
A population dynmaics model was built in Excel and extended in Python to evaluate long-term trends. 

## Tools Used
-Excel (model construction, scenario analysis)
-Python (pandas, matplotlib)
-Jupyter Notebook

## Model Descripstion 
The model divides the population into three groups:
- Youth
- Workewrs
- Retirees

Transition rates such as birth rate, workforce entry, retirement, and mortality are used to simulate population changes over multiple decades. 

## Analysis Performed 
-  Baseline population and workforce projection
-  Scenario analysis under demographic change
-  Workforce size comparison
-  Worker-to-retiree and dependency ratio analysis

## Key Insight 
Scenario analysis shows that changes in birth rates and retirement patterns can significantly impact long-term workforce sustainability.
